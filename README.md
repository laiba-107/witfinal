# React App with Axios and Bootstrap

This is a simple React application that demonstrates how to fetch user data from the [Reqres API](https://reqres.in/) using **Axios** for making HTTP requests and **Bootstrap** for styling the application.

## Features

- Fetches user data from a remote API (`https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1`).
- Displays a loading message while fetching the data.
- Handles errors and displays a message if the request fails.
- Uses **React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage component state.
- Styled using **Bootstrap** for a clean and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **React-Bootstrap**: React components built using Bootstrap.
